# Code Simplification Review
**Date**: 2026-02-07 17:26:00
**Mode**: gsd-task

## Findings

Reviewed session/types.rs implementation:

- [OK] Code is already clean and simple
- [OK] No nested ternary operators
- [OK] No unnecessary complexity
- [OK] Good use of pattern matching
- [OK] Early returns used appropriately
- [OK] No redundant abstractions

## Simplification Opportunities

None identified. The code follows Rust best practices and is already well-structured.

Specific strengths:
1. Clear type definitions with minimal nesting
2. Simple constructor patterns (new, new_root, new_child)
3. Direct implementations without over-engineering
4. Tests are straightforward and readable

## Grade: A

Code is already optimally simple for its purpose.
