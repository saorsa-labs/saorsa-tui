## Findings Tally (2+ votes required)

### CRITICAL Findings: 0
None.

### HIGH Findings: 0
None.

### MEDIUM Findings (suggestions, not blocking)

| Finding | Votes | Agents |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Duplicated model switching logic in main.rs (~160 lines) | 2 | Code Simplifier, Complexity |
| Similar import_skills/import_agents could share code | 2 | Code Simplifier, Complexity |
| Unmaintained `instant` transitive dependency | 1 | Security (not blocking) |

### LOW Findings

| Finding | Votes | Agents |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Complex HTML parsing in web_search.rs could be decomposed | 2 | Code Simplifier, Complexity |
| Nested session loading in main.rs | 1 | Code Simplifier |

## Build Verification

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| cargo check --workspace --all-targets | PASS |
| cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings | PASS (0 warnings) |
| cargo test --workspace | PASS (all tests) |
| cargo fmt --all -- --check | PASS |

## Decision

**REVIEW PASSED**

Exit conditions met:
- Zero CRITICAL findings
- Zero HIGH findings
- Build passes completely
- External reviewers unavailable (not blocking per review policy)

### MEDIUM findings assessment:
The two 2-vote MEDIUM findings (duplicated model switching logic, similar import functions) are valid refactoring suggestions but are NOT blocking for release. They represent code quality improvements that can be addressed in a future refactoring pass. The code is correct, tested, and functional as-is.

## Final Consensus Grade: **A**

Proceeding to commit-and-release.
