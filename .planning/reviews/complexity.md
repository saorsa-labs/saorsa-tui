# Complexity Review
**Date**: 2026-02-07 18:35:00

## Statistics
- tree.rs: ~250 LOC (reasonable)
- Recursive functions properly bounded
- Clear separation of concerns

## Findings
- [OK] Appropriate complexity for tree operations
- [OK] Recursive functions (build_tree_node_recursive, render_node_recursive) are clean

## Grade: A
