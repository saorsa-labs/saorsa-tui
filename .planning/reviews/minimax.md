## Grade: **A**

**Rationale:**
- Zero security concerns (no code changes)
- Zero error introduction (no code changes)
- Documentation updates appear well-structured and thorough
- Content deleted (reviews) was redundant with updated versions
- Codex session metadata properly captured

**Note:** This diff contains no functional changes. All modifications are internal planning/review documentation updates with no impact on production code, tests, or build output.
