## Findings by Severity

### CRITICAL (Must Fix)
None.

### HIGH (Should Fix)
None.

### MEDIUM (Consider)
None.

### LOW (Optional)
None.

### INFORMATIONAL
- Minor: CLI args in fae-app/cli.rs rather than fae-cli/args.rs (acceptable, fae-cli is thin wrapper)

2. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive with 16 new tests covering all requirements
3. **Build Quality**: Zero warnings, zero errors, all tests passing
4. **Type Safety**: Proper use of newtype pattern and type annotations
5. **Documentation**: All public APIs documented
6. **Security**: Atomic file writes, no injection vectors
7. **Code Quality**: Clean, idiomatic Rust with appropriate complexity
8. **Spec Compliance**: All requirements met, all tests passing

### Voting Summary
- PASS votes: 11/11 (100% of available reviewers)
- FAIL votes: 0/11 (0%)
- ABSTAIN: 4/15 (external reviewers unavailable)

### Action Required
