## Findings from This Change

### Autocomplete Changes (crates/saorsa/)

| Finding | Votes | Verdict |
|---------|-------|---------|
| No CRITICAL issues | 0 | N/A |
| No HIGH issues | 0 | N/A |
| u16 casts in ui.rs dropdown rendering | 1 (Type Safety) | SKIP - Safe: values bounded by terminal size |
| render_autocomplete could be split | 1 (Complexity) | SKIP - 60 lines is reasonable |
| AppState growing large (20+ fields) | 1 (Code Simplifier) | SKIP - Pre-existing, not part of this change |

### Pre-existing Workspace Findings (not blocking)

| Finding | Source | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|
| renderer.rs 1765 lines | Code Simplifier | Pre-existing, tracked |
| Provider code duplication | Code Simplifier | Pre-existing, tracked |
| tcss/matcher.rs 2 clippy warnings | Build (--all-targets) | Pre-existing test-only issue |

## Task Spec Compliance

- [x] Autocomplete state in AppState (app.rs) - 8 new methods, 2 new fields
- [x] Command descriptions (autocomplete.rs) - 20 commands with descriptions
- [x] Key interception (input.rs) - Up/Down/Tab/Enter/Escape handled, AutocompleteAccept variant
